This is where I will be storing my Dashboards

Dashboards Created:

* Personal Finance Dashboard V1.0 - Created on 30/09/2022

    Created by watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRtHNqafufg on YouTube and replicating it after the fact.

* Online Betting Dashboard V1.0 - Created on 14/10/2022

    Created after some weeks to maintain my skills regarding pivot tables and learn some new vba tricks.
    Since I do some small betting with some of my extra cash (and I used to have an excel betting tracker made by someone else) I thought this would be an amazing implementation of my knowledge and it would be very useful.

Future Plans

* Create excel workbook with my Magic The Gathering results so I have statistics on my deck performance and best matchups.

* Plan to create online forms so I can update my datasets from a browser on my phone instead of having to insert them all when I'm at home.

* Create all the same dashboards but using Tableau and databases instead.
